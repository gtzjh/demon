photochemical smog characterized by continuously rising levels of surface ozone  O3  has long been an air quality problem in Hong Kong  HK   Numerous studies attempted to address the combined effects of local chemistry and transboundary transport on O3 pollution in HK  However  a wide range of regional contributions were determined depending on many factors  such as weather patterns  and the estimates were based on assumed emission scenarios of air pollutants  The COVID 19 restrictions  especially the strict lockdowns in mainland China  provide us with a rare opportunity to examine the air quality impacts of human activities  While related work has been extensively carried out  the effects of mainland s lockdown on O3 formation regime and sensitivity in HK remain to be unraveled  In addition  HK imposed flexible restrictions to ease the epidemic  It is unknown how the measures were different from the strict lockdown in affecting O3 pollution  Further  derived from the air quality impacts of COVID 19 restrictions is a deeper question  Will persistent O3 attainment be achieved even if all local emissions of anthropogenic air pollutants are eliminated  The answer lies in the level of regional background O3  Moreover  O3 pollution in HK is very sensitive to weather  O3 control by reducing anthropogenic emissions must be designed for extreme weather conditions  which however has not been fully understood  In this project  we will i  reveal the changes in O3 and its precursors in HK during the pandemic  ii  compare the impacts of different levels of COVID 19 restriction on O3 pollution  photochemistry  and transboundary transport  iii  determine the regional background O3 and its variations over time  and iv  explore effective solutions to exacerbated O3

one of the important pathways for viral respiratory diseases including the recent pandemic COVID 19 to infect healthy people  it is extremely important to explore and understand the detailed mechanisms of virus spread through airborne expiratory droplets  To reduce the risk of exposure to viral respiratory diseases  the World Health Organization recommends main measures  namely hand hygiene  social distancing  and wearing masks  Among the recommended measures  there is a hot debate about social distancing related to the exposure risk  especially in indoor environments  Through expiratory activities  airborne virus laden droplets may spread over long distances  such as tens of meters in indoor environments  and remain in the air for a long time  making it an important route of exposure  Unfortunately  the scientific evidence on many public health policies regarding social distancing is still fragmentary  The public has only a rudimentary understanding of airborne transmission of viral respiratory diseases and proper social distancing  To address the concern of  whether the usual social distance is sufficient to avoid airborne infection of expiratory droplets in indoor environments   this project will use systematic  multidisciplinary experimental  theoretical and modelling approaches  The spatiotemporal variations of size distributions  velocity vector fields and airborne dynamics of expiratory droplets generated from people infected with Influenza A or B  and the quantities of influenza virus at different distances from the test subjects will be firstly measured using a suite of the state of the art instruments and methods  Bacteriophage phi 6 will then be used as a surrogate of coronavirus and other human pathogenic enveloped viruses to investigate the survivability and number of viruses in size resolved droplets at different time and locations from the release point under different environmental conditions  e g  temperature and relative humidity  with the aid of cultivation method and RT qPCR technique  Lastly  a versatile model of whole range airborne transmission will be developed and validated with experimental data to predict the airborne transmission of virus laden expiratory droplets and the risk of exposure to viable viruses  Different from previous models  more parameters will be integrated  especially including survivability and number of viruses in size resolved droplets at various distances and time  and impact of droplet concentration on the drag force on droplets under different environmental

negative impacts on air quality  human health  and climate  The increase has even been unintentionally accelerated since 2013  due to the nationwide implementation of the Clean Air Action Plan  as well as meteorological variations  Conversely  it is inferred with a few pieces of evidence that O3 in the continental outflows from China mainland stopped increasing or even began to decrease  In HK  air pollution control was started in early 2000s and has been continued to the present  Previous studies including those conducted by the project team examined the changes in O3 and the precursors resulting from certain control measures  However  most of the study periods were only up to 2013 2014  In recent years  the measures to tackle air pollution were extended and strengthened  such as phasing out high emission diesel vehicles  setting caps of sulfur content for vessel fuels  reducing emissions of power plants  and controlling the contents of volatile organic compounds in solvent products  A handful of studies confirmed the effectiveness of some measures in reducing primary air pollution  but the impacts on O3 air quality are unknown  At least  what we can see from the continuous monitoring data is that O3 kept increasing in HK in the recent decade  It is well documented that O3 pollution in this city relates to not only local emission and chemistry but also regional transport  outflows from China mainland   especially in autumn  and is sensitive to meteorology  Now that national and local air pollution controls were intensively implemented from 2013 2014 onwards  and they failed to curb the rise in HK s O3 levels  it is therefore essential to solve the puzzle  What has driven the recent O3 increase in HK  With this project  we will find the answer to this question  In brief  the research focuses on determining the recent variations of meteorology corrected O3 concentrations in HK and upwind regions in autumn  examining the changes in chemical profiles of O3 precursors  elucidating the impacts of the above changes on in situ and transport photochemistry  and quantitatively understanding the roles of multiple drivers in modulating the recent O3 increase in HK  The project will have strong policy implications with respect to effective O3 control and could become a paradigm for uncovering the mystery of rising O3 that is emerging in many

Tropospheric ozone  O3  pollution has been a long standing environmental issue for decades in many parts of the world  China is one of the countries that are shrouded in elevated ground level O3  Moreover  O3 increases across China have been well documented in recent decades  O3 pollution in South China was most serious in autumn  It was thought that the relatively clean air from South China Sea diluted the air pollution including O3 and O3 precursors in summer  resulting in lower O3 levels in South China than those in inland cities  In autumn  continental outflows induced by continental anticyclone and typhoons  together with warm climate  were most conducive to O3 production and accumulation in South China  Since 2013  an ambitious clean air action has been enforced in China  leading to significant reductions in emissions of many primary air pollutants  A handful of studies indicated that O3 in continental outflows in South China stopped increasing  Such changes meant that the autumnal O3 pollution in South China might be alleviated  Indeed  our preliminary analyses uncovered that the number of autumnal O3 nonattainment days in Hong Kong  an example of cities in South China  decreased from 2000 2009 to 2010 2019  In contrast  this number increased in summer  A recent paper also alerted us O3 was increasing in summer at the rate higher than that in any other seasons in Hong Kong  Despite that the summertime O3 levels are still much lower than those in autumn  the increasing number of O3 non attainment days and rising O3 levels in summer  opposite to the downward trends in autumn  call for attention  However  very few studies focused on summertime O3 pollution in South China  A recent study deduced that the growth of Southeast Asia  SEA  emissions was the driving factor of rising summertime O3 in Hong Kong  However  this conclusion was only based on the difference in O3 trends between observation and simulation with fixed SEA emissions  We will put emphases on chemical characterization of SEA emissions and their aging products in South China  figuring out the occurrence  transport and aging processes of SEA emissions  and quantifying the impacts of SEA emissions on O3 pollution in South China in this project  through analyses of historical data  field observation  and application of box and chemical transport models  The successful completion
